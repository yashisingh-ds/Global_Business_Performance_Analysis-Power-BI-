# 🌍 Global Business Performance Analysis (Power BI)

Developed a comprehensive executive-level Power BI dashboard to monitor key business metrics, including revenue, profit margins, and regional return rates, using simulated datasets. Utilized Power Query for efficient ETL processes and DAX for creating advanced, dynamic measures. The dashboard provides actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and seasonal demand trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management, returns optimization, and supply chain strategy.

## 🎯 Project Objective
Develop an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that helps businesses:  
- Track total sales, profit, and quantities by product and region  
- Identify high-performing and underperforming areas  
- Visualize monthly and yearly trends, i.e, Total sales by Months and Years.
- Enable **data-driven decision-making** for strategic growth

  ## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard creation and reporting  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and ETL transformations  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Dynamic KPI and metric calculations  
- **Excel/CSV** – Raw dataset source  

## 🔹 Key Features
- **Cleaned & Transformed Data:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and structured the dataset for analysis  
- **Dynamic KPIs & DAX Measures:**
